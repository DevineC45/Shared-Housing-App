            <h4>ðŸ§¹ Chore Management</h4>
            <p>
                Tenants can create, assign, and track household tasks with ease. No more confusion over whoâ€™s doing what â€” 
                everyone sees the same chore list, updated in real-time. This keeps the home running smoothly and prevents 
                misunderstandings.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Tenants stay organised and accountable, while landlords can be confident the property is being maintained.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h4>ðŸ’° Expense Tracking</h4>
            <p>
                Record payments, split costs fairly, and view past settled expenses all in one place. Only the person who paid 
                can mark an expense as settled, ensuring accuracy and transparency.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Tenants avoid awkward money conversations, and landlords have an overview of any shared costs or utility payments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h4>ðŸ“… Shared Calendar</h4>
            <p>
                Schedule events, inspections, or meetings and share them instantly with all members of the household. Only event creators 
                can edit or delete their events, keeping control in the right hands.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Tenants never miss cleaning days, rent deadlines, or house meetings. Landlords can communicate key dates like maintenance visits with zero hassle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h4>ðŸ“¢ Announcements</h4>
            <p>
                Landlords can post important updates such as policy changes, safety notices, or maintenance schedules. Tenants 
                can see announcements immediately upon logging in, ensuring nobody misses critical information.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Landlords have a direct line of communication, and tenants stay informed without relying on group chats or scattered emails.</p>
