                Homigo combines essential shared living tools into one easy-to-use platform — designed for both tenants and landlords.

                <h4 class="fw-bold">Chore Management</h4>
                <p>
                    Tenants can create, assign, and track household tasks with ease. No more confusion over who’s doing what — 
                    everyone sees the same chore list, updated in real-time. This keeps the home running smoothly and prevents 
                    misunderstandings.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Tenants stay organised and accountable, while landlords can be confident the property is being maintained.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4 class="fw-bold">Expense Tracking</h4>
                <p>
                    Record payments, split costs fairly, and view past settled expenses all in one place. Only the person who paid 
                    can mark an expense as settled, ensuring accuracy and transparency.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Tenants avoid awkward money conversations, and landlords have an overview of any shared costs or utility payments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4 class="fw-bold">Shared Calendar</h4>
                <p>
                    Schedule events, inspections, or meetings and share them instantly with all members of the household. Only event creators 
                    can edit or delete their events, keeping control in the right hands.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Tenants never miss cleaning days, rent deadlines, or house meetings. Landlords can communicate key dates like maintenance visits with zero hassle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4 class="fw-bold">Announcements</h4>
                <p>
                    Landlords can post important updates such as policy changes, safety notices, or maintenance schedules. Tenants 
                    can see announcements immediately upon logging in, ensuring nobody misses critical information.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Landlords have a direct line of communication, and tenants stay informed without relying on group chats or scattered emails.</p>
